# EpochX

This guide is for anyone just starting out with the EpochX framework. It will outline the essential information needed to get started.

## What is EpochX?

EpochX is a Java framework for studying the evolution of computer programs generated using Genetic Programming algorithms. Versions 1.1+ have
3 fully supported representations: **Strongly-typed Tree GP**, **Context-Free Grammar GP** and **Grammatical Evolution**. However, EpochX's extendible structure
makes it possible to implement entirely new representations within the bounds of the evolutionary framework. A wide range of implementations are
provided to perform selection, initialisation, crossover, mutation... as well as many of the common benchmark problems that GP is frequently tested
upon.

## Getting Started with Models

The key to using EpochX is in the use of models. A model is simply a Java class which defines how execution for a problem should proceed; it provides
the run parameters, the fitness function and other configurable options. All models extend from the abstract Model class, which provides default values
for many standard parameters. Typically a new model will actually extend from one of GPModel, GRModel or GEModel (for tree GP, CFG-GP and GE respectively),
which provide further defaults for each of the representation's parameters. Models are provided pre-constructed for a number of standard problems for each 
representation. Overriding a modelï¿½s default value for a parameter can be performed simply by calling the associated setter method.

Triggering execution of evolutionary runs with your model is simply a case of calling the model's run method. Where the `SantaFeTrail` class is one of the built
in models:
```
new SantaFeTrail().run();
```
This single line is all that is required to start evolving solutions to the Santa Fe trail problem. However, that's not much good without some output and EpochX provides two powerful mechanisms to get your hands on all manner of outputs.

## Obtaining Statistics

The system provides a stats manager called Stats, which is retrievable using the static method `Stats.get()`. The components of the EpochX framework will put data and statistics into the stats manager as runs progress. That data is then retrievable at any point from your code. Where possible the statistics are calculated lazily only when requested.

Each statistic can be requested with a call to the `getStat(Stat)` method. The parameter must be an instance of `Stat` and is the statistics field you wish to retrieve. See the StatField class for some example statistics fields, other collections of statistics fields are available throughout the framework, such as on operators that provide statistics specific to their operation. The JavaDoc on the constants that provide many of the built-in `Stat` fields indicate the instance type of the object that is returned which is handy so it can be cast back upon retrieval. Alternatively, a sequence of stats fields can be requested at once with the `getStats(String[])` method which will return an array of the statistics retrieved. The stats manager also provides a series of methods that will print those statistics to the console or other output stream:
```
Stats.get().print(Stat... fields);
```
Having statistics available for retrieval about generations, crossovers, etc. is only useful if we have the facility to obtain the statistics at each of these events. For this we have an event handling system.

## Handling Events

A reference to the life cycle manager (`Life`) can be obtained with a call to `Life.get()`. The Life object maintains a set of listeners for life cycle events such as the start and end of runs, generations, crossovers etc. Listeners can be added to the `Life` to listen for these events. Typically this would be done with an anonymous implementation of one of the event adapters. Any action could be performed on occurrence of these events but in particular it is convenient to make use of the statistics. For example:

```java
Life.get().addGenerationListener(new GenerationAdapter(){
    public void onGenerationEnd() {
        Stats.get().print(StatField.GEN_NUMBER);
    }
});
```

# Example #1: Built-in Models

EpochX comes with a number of built-in models which define suitable setups and fitness functions for the common benchmark problems. To get started we will get one of these running, we'll use even-4 parity using tree GP. You can find the even parity model in the org.epochx.gp.models package.

Create a new Java class with a `public static void main(String[] args)` method. Call the class whatever you wish. Inside the main method we just need the following lines of code in order to start evolving some GP programs.

```java
GPModel model = new EvenParity(4);
Life.get().addGenerationListener(new GenerationAdapter(){
    public void onGenerationEnd() {
        Stats.get().print(StatField.GEN_NUMBER,
                          StatField.GEN_FITNESS_MIN,
                          StatField.GEN_FITTEST_PROGRAM);
        }
});
model.run();
```

Line 1 constructs the model, lines 2-8 defines what statistics we would like to print each generation and line 7 executes our model. It is that simple. We could have left out lines 2-8 and our model would still have evolved, but there would not have been any output. If you are trying to run the code, ensure you include the following imports at the top:

```java
import org.epochx.gp.model.*;
import org.epochx.life.*;
import org.epochx.stats.*;
```

If you execute this class the console output should be a stream of 3 columns, something like:

```
0   5.0  OR(IF(OR(AND(OR(AND(D2 D3) AND(D2 D1))...
1   5.0  OR(IF(OR(AND(OR(AND(D2 D3) AND(D2 D1))...
2   3.0  IF(IF(NOT(IF(OR(IF(D3 D1 D3) NOT(D1))...
3   3.0  IF(IF(NOT(IF(OR(IF(D3 D1 D3) NOT(D1))...
4   2.0  IF(IF(NOT(IF(OR(IF(D3 D1 D3) NOT(D1))...
5   2.0  IF(IF(NOT(IF(OR(IF(D3 D1 D3) NOT(D1))...
6   2.0  IF(IF(NOT(IF(OR(IF(D3 D1 D3) NOT(D1))...
... ...  ...
```
The first column is the generation number, where generation 0 is the result of initialisation. Then the second and third columns are the minimum fitness (i.e. the best fitness when using standardised fitness) and the best program, as requested on lines 5 and 6 of our code. You could experiment with different stats fields available in the StatField class.

If everything is running smoothly then you should see the minimum fitness value gradually dropping towards zero in the later generations.

## Setting parameters

This is just the bare minimum to run a model, and currently we are using all the default parameter values as specified by Model and GPModel classes, but now we want to provide our own. GPModel has many methods to set parameters, see the JavaDoc documentation for a full list, but we will use a couple of them now. Let's set the population size, the number of generations and the maximum program depth.

```java
GPModel model = new EvenParity(4);
model.setPopulationSize(500);
model.setNoGenerations(100);
model.setMaxDepth(8);
\\ remainder of the code as above
```

Lines 2, 3 and 4 have been inserted to set these parameters. Another interesting parameter we can set is the number of runs setNoRuns(int) which makes performing 50 or 100 runs for the sake of experimentation very easy.

## Setting components

As well as the basic run parameters, many of the components in EpochX are configurable and changeable. In exactly the same way as we set the parameters, we can set these components. In the following code we will change the crossover operator, the program selector and the random number generator.

```java
GPModel model = new EvenParity(4);
model.setCrossover(new UniformPointCrossover(model));
model.setProgramSelector(new TournamentSelector(model, 7));
model.setRNG(new MersenneTwisterFast());
\\ remainder of the code as above
```

Lines 2, 3 and 4 have been changed to set the new components. The main difference is that we must pass in an instance of the component to use, and it is common for components to need access to the model that is being used, since it may define relevant parameters for the component. Some components will also have their own options, settable with arguments to the constructor or setter methods, such as the new `TournamentSelector` we created which takes the tournament size as an argument.

See Appendix A for the full code listing of this example.

# Example #2: Creating a New GP Model

Whilst the benchmark models which are provided with EpochX define many of the problems which you may wish to execute, undoubtedly, it is necessary to be able to create your own. Creating a new model in EpochX is a simple process though. A 6-bit multiplexer model already exists in the built-in EpochX models, but for the purposes of demonstrating a simple model, we'll create a new one here.

Create a new Java class called Mux6, which extends GPModel. There are two main things that must be provided to implement our new model:

- The function set
- The terminal set
- An appropriate fitness function

Providing the fitness function is by implementing the abstract `getFitness` method inherited from the Model class. The `getFitness` method receives an instance of `CandidateProgram` as an argument and must determine a `double` fitness score for that program. EpochX uses standardised fitness so the fitness score that is returned should reflect that with a lower value signifying a better program. How the method calculates the score is up to you, the model designer, to decide. Typically the fitness would be based upon the quality of the program after executing it upon some inputs. We will come back to writing our fitness function shortly.

The other tasks of providing the function and terminal sets are actually performed as one in EpochX, since functions and terminals are not distinguished. A terminal is merely a `Node` with an arity of zero, whereas a function is a `Node` with an arity of one or more. We refer to the combined set of the functions and terminals as the syntax. We can set the syntax that is to be used using the GPModel's `setSyntax` method which passes a `List` of instances of all the nodes that the system can use in constructing program trees. We only want to do this once so inside the constructor is a good place to do this.

```java
public Mux6() {
    // Construct the variables into fields.
    d3 = new BooleanVariable("d3");
    d2 = new BooleanVariable("d2");
    d1 = new BooleanVariable("d1");
    d0 = new BooleanVariable("d0");
    a1 = new BooleanVariable("a1");
    a0 = new BooleanVariable("a0");
    List<Node> syntax = new ArrayList<Node>();
    // Functions.
    syntax.add(new IfFunction());
    syntax.add(new AndFunction());
    syntax.add(new OrFunction());
    syntax.add(new NotFunction());
    // Terminals.
    syntax.add(d3);
    syntax.add(d2);
    syntax.add(d1);
    syntax.add(d0);
    syntax.add(a1);
    syntax.add(a0);
    setSyntax(syntax);
}
```

We need to keep a reference to all the variables in fields so we can change their values to each of our test inputs during fitness evaluation. If we had a lot of inputs we might choose to use a Map or other collection to store them.

So, back to the `getFitness` method. The fitness of a program in our 6-bit multiplexer will be 64 minus the number of correct outputs after trying all 64 input combinations, so a fitness of 0.0 will mean success on all inputs. Assuming we have initialised a `boolean[][]` field, inputs, that contains all the possible combinations of inputs, and outputs, that contains the corresponding correct output response, the structure of our `getFitness` function will be:

```java
public double getFitness(GPCandidateProgram program) {
    double score = 0;
    for (int i=0; i<inputs.length; i++) {
        // Set the variables.
        a0.setValue(inputs[i][0]);
        a1.setValue(inputs[i][1]);
        d0.setValue(inputs[i][2]);
        d1.setValue(inputs[i][3]);
        d2.setValue(inputs[i][4]);
        d3.setValue(inputs[i][5]);
        Boolean result = (Boolean) program.evaluate();
        if (result == outputs[i]) {
            score++;
        }
    }
    return 64 - score;
}
```

To evaluate our program with each set of variables, we set the value of each of our `BooleanVariable` objects which we have held a reference to. Then we simply call the `evaluate()` method on the program to trigger an evaluation of the program tree.

Once we've completed our model, we can then execute it in the same way as in Example #1, by calling its run() method:

```
new Mux6().run();
```

See Appendix B for the full code listing of this example.

# Conclusions

This is as far as we are going to go in the Quickstart Guide, hopefully it was enough to demonstrate some of the power of EpochX and the ease with which you can wield it. It is only possible to scratch the surface of EpochX with such a short guide, so we recommend taking a look at the javadoc for more detailed information.
